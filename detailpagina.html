            If the notion of bitcoin intrigues you, yet you find yourself
            intimidated by the complicated techno-jargon surrounding it, then
            the documentary "Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble" is for you. This
            incisive overview explains the intricacies of the cryptocurrency in
            an engrossing and easily digestible manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            The film begins with an examination of popular currencies throughout
            history, including our long-time reliance on precious metals like
            gold and silver as well as the system of the U.S. dollar that is
            most commonly employed today. Bitcoin is viewed by many as the next
            logical evolution from these currencies, and a highly desirable one
            at that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin, coupled with an interface known as blockchain, is a
            completely decentralized network that eliminates all intermediaries
            from the currency exchange process. This is one of the major factors
            that set it apart from dealings with traditional banks or credit
            card companies, and it's a significant reason why these firmly
            established institutions are threatened by the growing popularity of
            the cryptocurrency.
          </p>

          <p>
            The network is especially useful for those who are not active
            members of the banking system, but its benefits transcend the needs
            of the individual. As detailed in the film, currency insecure
            countries are using bitcoin to avoid dealing with corrupt
            governments and greed-infested central banking systems. Many of the
            world's wealthiest regions are hesitant to engage in financial
            transactions with third world countries due to rampant credit card
            fraud. Bitcoin eliminates this risk, and thereby opens up a new
            realm of revitalization for these impoverished nations. Incredibly,
            it can also be used to enhance privacy standards, protect the
            integrity of national elections, and help struggling families across
            the globe in procuring property rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            The film dives headfirst into answering bitcoin's most ardent
            critics, including on issues related to the endurance of the
            technology if it should grow far beyond expectations in the near
            future, and the securities that are in place to prevent widespread
            fraud.
          </p>

          <p>
            Featuring insightful testimonies from prominent leaders and
            prognosticators on the global financial stage, "Bitcoin: Beyond the
            Bubble" paints an optimistic impression of an empowering future
            where everyone can be in charge of their own money.

            I am working with cryptos since 2013 or 2014 i think and all i can
            say it's changing the world. Literally. Cryptocurrencies are not
            going go replace banks, even if it can be done easily because they
            are just better, banks won't allow that, they will evolve and most
            likely they will develop their own centralized crypto currency(i
            guess there will be one that will be world wide adopted). What
            bitcoin and cryptos are is the great alternative that we will always
            have. We didn't had something like that never so this is a powerful
            thing. Bitcoin isnt a get rich scheme, even if most people are using
            it just for that and probably we won't see this transition to
            cryptos for some time but when people start seeing 1 BTC as a 1 BTC
            and not XXXX dollars, that would be a sign of a new financial
            system.

            John Payne> Crypto is challenging the banking cartel's ability to
            steal purchasing power, through inflation, and lend it out at
            interest - legally. It's theft, plain and simple - except it legal.
            No-one donates more to political parties than the banks. There's a
            reason for that. Of course they will fight for this, and use the
            considerable political power they have. This is a battle that has to
            be won by crypto. Everyone knows this. One thing is for sure though
            - laws CANNOT stop crypto. This is a war. The peoples right to their
            purchasing power versus the elites who think they have a right to
            decide what money is worth, and will exploit that right. Bitcoin is
            pretty open at the moment, but technology is already on the way, to
            make it more anonymous. I personally believe crypto will win in the
            end, and give the power of money back to the people - where it
            belongs. Seems to me, you're rooting for the banks. Maybe you're
            just ignorant, like most people are about crypto, or maybe you're
            a banker. You should be part of it. It's your children's future too.

            Bitcoin offers some potential yet it is fully traceable, which in
            the hands of authoritarian governments is very dangerous. Anonymous
            decentralized systems that act like cash offer the public more
            protections. Some say these cryptos can be used by criminals, but
            already the US dollar is the most used anonymous currency in the
            world for weapons, war, and drugs so what's the difference? The
            issue of "Whales" needs to be addressed since they can manipulate
            the market...oh wait, that's right the 1% that has most of the
            world's wealth already do that with the economies of the world
            today.

            There is never enough documentaries for new people to understand
            more about Bitcoin and Blockchain tech.
